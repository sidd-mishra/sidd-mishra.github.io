        <h1>Credit Card Summary Web Service Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            I loved the online assessment coding up a Credit Card Summary function. It was an interesting experience for me because I love learning about new applications and then making them up from scratch. Thus, this weekend, I developed a simple web service that supports submitting new events and getting updated summaries via a REST API. I have significant experience doing this before in Java using the Spring Framework from my time at Jefferies Investment Banking this summer so I wanted to learn how to do it this time in Python. I used Python’s FastAPI framework to achieve this and deployed it on the public domain using Railway and some minimal front end.

        <h2>Features and Functionality</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Event-Based Credit Summary Calculation:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Accepts a range of event types (e.g., TXN_AUTHED, TXN_SETTLED).</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Endpoints:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>POST /summarize: Processes incoming transaction events and calculates the credit summary.</li>
                            <li>GET /: Serves the HTML interface, allowing users to input events and see summaries interactively.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Calculates available credit and payable balance based on event history.</li>
                    <li>Distinguishes between pending and settled transactions, displaying only recent entries in the settled list.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>RESTful API:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Built with FastAPI, it leverages endpoints to receive transaction data and return summaries.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>User Interface:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>A basic HTML/Javascript interface allows users to manually input event data.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Data Validation with Pydantic:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Input Models:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Event: Represents a single event with attributes like eventType, eventTime, txnId, and an optional amount.</li>
                            <li>SummaryRequest: Represents the credit limit and the list of Event objects.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Output Models:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>SummaryResponse: Structurally defines the API’s JSON response with fields for available credit, payable balance, pending transactions, and settled transactions.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>
            This is a very basic feature that I’ve deployed for now. I plan on adding more things to it as we progress through the interview process. I’m so excited!
